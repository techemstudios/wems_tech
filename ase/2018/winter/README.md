# WEMS ASE - Winter 2018  

Elementary Tech Session 2: Focuses on learning coding and how to make learning it easy! - Using visual coding apps, students will learn about the basics of computer programming and how we make computers do what we want.  

## Day One  

#### Materials:  

* Hopsctoch iPad app  
    - Many of the lessons pertaining to the Hopscotch app are pulled from the [hopscotch curriculum files bucket](http://hopscotch-curriculum-files.s3.amazonaws.com/Hopscotch%20Curriculum%202015.pdf)    

Intro/Review  
* A program is...  
    - programming means to relay instructions to a computer on what to do  
    - **Sequence**  

Ipad Activity  
* Hopscotch  
    - simple intro/review  
    - Create a simple game  
        - Objectives:  
            - Drag & drop code to have a character's movements controled via buttons  
            - Code the character to be able to move up, down, left and right  
            - Understand +X & +Y / -X & -Y directions  
            - Understand code blocks  

    - Add to the game e.g. make it multiplayer, add more movement capabilities, etc

## Day Two  

### Key Terms Activity: Construction Paper Flash cards  

*20 min*  

Have the class create their set of flashcards for important key terms we will be using regularly throughout class. The terms, or concepts will be related to what project the class is working on. The first group project is to create a frogger-style game on the Hopscotch app. Below is a list each concept and its definition to be put on a flash card by each student.  

* Sequence - the order in which instructions are given (to a computer)  
* Event - A trigger that a computer listens for/recognizes and causes it to do something  
    - example: in Hopscotch, all events start with the word "WHEN"; it begins the *rule*. Think of it as a "WHEN this..., THEN this happens..." sentence.  
    - Events are essential for computer engineers in general, because they tell a machine when exactly it should perform an action. For instance, when you touch the phone icon on your home screen, your phone then brings up the interface to make calls.  
    - Realworld example: When you raise your hand (a trigger) in class, then you are called on (action) by a teacher.  
* Loop - Code that repeats  
* Conditional - "IF (something is true), THEN (do an action)" statements  
* Code Block - A group of programming statements  
* Bug - a mistake in your code  
* Debugging - finding the bugs/mistakes and fixing them  

**Materials** - [coding_terms_flashcard_activity.pdf](https://github.com/techemstudios/wems_tech/blob/master/ase/2018/winter/activities/coding_terms_flashcard_activity.pdf)  

**Procedure** - Hand out seven cards (can be cut-out construction paper, etc.) to each student. As the instructor discusses each topic, have the students write the concept name and what it means (ideally in their own words) on one side of the card. Use the other side of the card to draw out an example of the concept; have students try to come up with an example on their own. For any example they come with, guide them to create any that will help them remember what the concept is all about. Remind students throughout, to write their names on each card.  

Collect the cards at the end. If time, laminate the cards, and string each set together.  

### Hopsctoch  
#### Frogger (Crossy Road)  

*20 min*  

Have the class start setting up their own frogger game with what they did in class the day before: Have a character's movements controlled by a set of directional buttons (up/down/left/right button emojis). See how far they can get without any help.  

*10 min*  

As students finish their initial setup of the game, they can explore the Hopscotch app.
