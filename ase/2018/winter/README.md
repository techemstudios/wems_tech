## Day Two  

### Key Terms Activity: Construction Paper Flash cards  

*20 min*  

Have the class create their set of flashcards for important key terms we will be using regularly throughout class. The terms, or concepts will be related to what project the class is working on. The first group project is to create a frogger-style game on the Hopscotch app. Below is a list each concept and its definition to be put on a flash card by each student.  

* Sequence - the order in which instructions are given (to a computer)  
* Event - A trigger that a computer listens for/recognizes and causes it to do something  
* Loop - Code that repeats  
* Conditional - "IF (something is true), THEN (do an action)" statements  
* Code Block - A group of programming statements  
* Bug - a mistake in your code  
* Debugging - finding the bugs/mistakes and fixing them  

**Procedure**  

Hand out seven cards (can be cut-out construction paper, etc.) to each student. As the instructor discusses each topic, have the students write the concept name and what it means (ideally in their own words) on one side of the card. Use the other side of the card to draw out an example of the concept; have students try to come up with an example on their own. For any example they come with, guide them to create any that will help them remember what the concept is all about.

### Frogger (Crossy Road)  

Have the class start setting up their own frogger game with what they did in class the day before: Have a character's movements controlled by a set of directional buttons (up/down/left/right button emojis). See how far they can get without any help.
