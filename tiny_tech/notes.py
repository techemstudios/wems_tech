    # intros
    # what is technology? computers? program?
    # discussed recipes and steps to make pb&j
    # discussed sequences. What if the recipe was out of order?
    # out of seat programming activity
    # Kodable
        # created kodable class instance for tracking progress
            # starting next week
    # very young group

# 10/9
    # Columbus Day: no school

# 10/16
    # review what is technology? Computer? Program? Sequence?
    # Make an algorithm for your morning routine
        # The steps for a typical morning routine were provided on slips of construction paper
        # students place/glue the steps in order (for the most part) on a seperate sheet of paper
    # Kodable
        # first saved profile/progress for kodable app
        # finished sequences
        # discussed conditions: "if this happens, then this happens"
        # example: "if you eat everything on your dinner plate, then you can..."
        # started first level of conditions

# 10/23
    # Layers of a Computer System
        # Hands-on activity, drawing and putting the layers together to take home
    # ended with Kodable

# 10/30
    # Kodable and Lightbot

# 11/6
    # From Tiny Tech lesson plan, discussed conditions
    # used deck of cards for simple conditional game
        # Played several differnet way, or created several different programs using
        # conditonal rules, kept score for some
    # Kodable: refocus on what conditions actually are and where we can find them/how to recognize them (in real life too),
    # and how to approach solving them in Kodable.

    # Tried our hand out creating our own puzzles in Kodable
        # However, group may be too young.. will try another step-by-step approach next week.
