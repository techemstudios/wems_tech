### Discuss Technology & Computers  

*5min*  

What is technology? When you hear the word technology, what do you think of?  

Is a table, or a chair is considered technology? Yes! Technology is anything created by humans to make people's lives easier or solves a problem. Ask if anyone has used a computer, ask for examples of a computer. Discuss what computers are. Early computers were devices that helped people with math, modern computers are devices for manipulating information and displaying it.  

### What is a Computer Program?  

*5 min*  

Simply a set of instructions written by humans that causes the computer to perform some action. Coding and programming are synonymous.  

Discuss difference between Hardware and Software.  

### Out-of-Seat Programming Exercise  

*5 - 10 min*

Pick four volunteers to form two groups. Each group has a designated programmer and robot. Have each group stand in same area of the classroom. Point out a place in the room to be a destination. Explain that the programmer needs to give their robot step-by-step to get to the destination by telling the robot to walk forward (x amount of steps) or turn (90 degrees, left or right). The robot can only follow the directions given by their programmer.  

                  Go Forward 3 steps  
                  Turn left 90 degrees
                  Go forward 5 steps  
                  etc.  

Ask the class, which group was more efficient (the least amount of steps).   

### Programming with Kodable  

Have instance of class setup from the Kodable website, so students can track their progress. The first set of exercises deals with the concept of sequences. Note different points from the discussions and activities earlier in class.

### Review  

What is technology?  

Fill in the blanks: Technology is anything created by humans to make our lives `__________` and solves `_____________`. Is a table, chair, or even a sink considered technology?  

What is a program?  

Some technology comes with directions, step-by-step instructions on how to put it together. Offer examples of things that come with instructions i.e. a new bike, toy, legos, etc. Someone, a person, had to write those directions.  

A computer program is exactly that; step-by-step instructions to tell the computer what to do. Just as before, a person had to write those instructions to tell the computer what to do. If computers did not have those instructions, or programs, they would not do a thing. Relate this to the fuzzball in Kodable. If we did not give it instructions to follow, the fuzzball would just sit there, not doing a thing.  

 A sequence is a particular order in which things follow each other. Have you ever eaten a bowl of cereal? What if your Mom poured the milk **before** she put the bowl out?! Discuss the correct sequence for pouring a bowl of cereal.  

### PB & J Algorithm  

Have students put together the steps to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the *correct* order, using the provided construction paper.  

## Code  

*5 min*  

Code lets you communicate! In general, *code* is a system for transferring information. People use code to communicate with another, and between a person and a machine. Examples:  

* Morse  
  - light (flashlights, sun & mirrors, etc.)  
  - sound  
  - dots & dashes (telegraph machines)  
* Braille    
* Human Languages  
  - sign  
  - speech  
  - written
  - shorthand (stenography)  
* Computer languages  

### How Computers Manage Information   

*10 min*  

Computers *speak* using binary; where only the digits 0 and 1 are used. Zero is "coded" to mean OFF, one is "coded" to mean ON. Relate to a light switch.

Use a small whiteboard to explain how computers translate numbers we use; decimal number system into the binary number system --by explaining the difference between the two by focusing on the place values.  

Decimal numbers use a **Base 10** system, meaning it uses a total of ten digits:

                    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  

Binary numbers use a Base 2 system, two digits:  

                    0 1

Because of the age group, put more focus on explaining the binary number system, rather than the decimal number system. Explain with the binary flashcards.  

#### Make your own Binary Flashcards  

Activity to visually see how the binary number system operates by practicing a method that converts decimal numbers to binary. Ask for five volunteers. Reiterate the place values. Explain that when the card is flipped to show the darker side, this means the place value is OFF, or zero. When the card is flipped to show the dots, the value is ON, or one. flip the correct cards (turn "ON") to collectively show the number, one in binary. Do this for the numbers, 2 - 10.
